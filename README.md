# Usability Testing Analysis with Mouse Tracking and Facial Expressions

The ultimate aim of the project is to combine concepts from two different worlds : software engineering 👩🏻‍💻 and AI 🤖, to create a smart software for facilitating usability testing analysis by using mouse tracking and facial expressions.

The goal of the project is to answer the following question: How can we support the usability testing process with data to help determine if a system is usable or not 📈? This can be achieved by leveraging the power of AI.

The mechanics of the solution are as follows: The software generates a real-time plot that shows changes in the user's facial expressions during the performance of required tasks😊. Additionally, it tracks and compares the user's mouse movements to a standard path, saving the results for analysis 🎮.
